# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	
  This project was initiated as a way to analyze kickstarter campaign data using the provided information, broken down into categories, including goals, pledges, amount of backers, and launch and end dates.	

### Purpose
	
  The purpose of this project was to analyze kickstarter campaign data, with an emphasis on theaters and plays, paying close attention to launch dates and fundraising goals, to help Louise compare her play’s “Fever” results to other plays. She can use the data we’ve provided to help her determine when to start future campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As visualized in the following graphic, campaigns had the highest rate of success between the months of April and August with May and June displaying the highest rate of successful campaigns. This chart was made by analyzing the start date of each campaign in the theater category and comparing the successful, failed, and canceled campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	
  The following graphic is a visualization of the analysis of plays’ outcomes based on campaign goals. This information helps to determine if the outcome of the goals is affected by the dollar amount of the goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	
  One challenge I encountered while completing the “Outcome Based on Goals” chart was rearranging the dollar amounts from smallest to largest.  When I first created the chart, the “Less than 1000” and “5000 to 9999” goals, appeared at the end of the chart, instead of the beginning.  While the information may have still been correct, the chart did not have the correct flow and was not as user friendly as it could be.  To solve this problem, I had to sort the goals manually and I had not had to that before. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	
	The first conclusion to be drawn from the “Outcomes based on Launch Date” is that campaigns launched between April and August had the highest success rates, with May and June displaying numbers of successful campaigns, with 111 and 100, which is double that of the months with the lowest success rate, November and December.  This information implies that starting a campaign in the summer may give the campaign a greater chance at success. 
	The second conclusion to be drawn is that failed campaigns were relatively consistent from month to month, especially when compared to the variation of successful campaigns on a monthly basis.  This information implies that campaigns may fail based on other factors outside of launch date.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	
	The information gathered from the “Outcomes based on Goals” implies that the lower the campaign goal, the higher the rate of success, with exceptions in the $35,000-$39,999 and the $40,000-$44,999 categories.  However, hardly any campaigns were started with goals of $35,000-$44,999 so the data is skewed. Therefore, it can be assumed that having a campaign with a lower goal will yield a higher rate of success.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	
	Since the failed campaigns did not vary as greatly of the successful campaigns, one limitation on the “Outcomes based on Launch Date” is not knowing what other outside factors could have affected the outcomes. A limitation on the “Outcomes based Goals” chart is that only percentages are displayed.  Without looking at the data table, a clear representation of successful and failed campaigns cannot be seen by viewing the chart alone. The chart does not consider the number of campaigns run.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	Another chart that could be made would display the number of successful and failed outcomes based on goals.
